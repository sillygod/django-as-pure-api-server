# Django as Pure Api Server

This is a template structure for pure api server with Django. I will update the libraries or frameworks to the latest version for a period of time. Maybe I will keep some notes for the libraries below.


# Api Document

I still use `restframework swagger` currently although `rest framework` has bulit-in interactive api doc from version 3.6. That's because it lacks customization.
